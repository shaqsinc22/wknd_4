# In this example, we have THREE calculators, the two included in the previous
# exercises as well as Whiz Bang Calculator that can even calculate the hypotenuse
# of a triangle if given the length of the other two sides. Figure out how to 
# DRY up all the code below - there shouldn't be a single method duplicated between
# any two classes.

module SimpleCalculator

  def add(first_number, second_number)
    first_number + second_number
  end

  def subtract(first_number, second_number)
    first_number - second_number
  end

  def multiply(first_number, second_number)
    first_number * second_number
  end

  def divide(first_number, second_number)
    first_number / second_number
  end

end
